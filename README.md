# Pokemon Team Builder

Built using React, this is my Pokemon Team Suggester app. For now, it will only use the first generation of Pokemon.
The landing page will tell about the function of the app and the Pokedex page will show the complete first generation of Pokemon.
On the Pokedex page, a button labeled Suggest a Team will ask for two type choices and return up to 6 Pokemon that match the type choices.
As of now, the function is pretty simple but I aim to add more functionality down the road, for example, adding a backend for account creation to be able to choose Pokemon teams and save/share them.
